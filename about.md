Hi!  
I am Serhii, a PhD student at the [ILCC](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc), the University of Edinburgh. Previously, I had been working on my thesis at the [ILLC](https://www.illc.uva.nl/), University of Amsterdam.  

Prior to starting PhD, I had been working as a 
research engineer at [Grammarly Inc](https://www.grammarly.com). 
There, I was focusing on solving natural language error correction 
tasks with machine learning approaches. I have Bachelor’s and Master’s 
degrees in applied mathematics from the 
National Technical University of Ukraine “KPI”.

volunteering background on my LinkedIn
