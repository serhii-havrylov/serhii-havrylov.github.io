Hi!  
I am Serhii, a PhD candidate at the [ILLC](https://www.illc.uva.nl/), 
University of Amsterdam.  

Prior to joining ILLC, I had been working as a 
research engineer at [Grammarly Inc](https://www.grammarly.com). 
There, I was focusing on solving natural language error correction 
tasks with machine learning approaches. I have Bachelor’s and Master’s 
degrees in applied mathematics from the 
National Technical University of Ukraine “KPI”.  

You can see a quick summary of my professional, educational and 
volunteering background on my LinkedIn 
[profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/serhii-havrylov-666796a7).
